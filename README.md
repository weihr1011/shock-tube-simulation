# shock-tube-simulation
This is one of my project in 4th year computational physics course at university of Manitoba. The code templete(comments in the code) was provided by teaching assistant of this course. This program compares exact solution with Roe's scheme for simulating Sod's shock tube. The main program is shockTube.m.
